        Although I more commonly go by just "Rielle," my name is Rielle Marie Quejada. I am the youngest of 
        four siblings and the only one in my family who doesn't need glasses in their day to day life.
        While I am a mathematics major with an intent to go into education, my interest in programming 
        is growing after having taken CIS 103 and 180 last year. That combined with my love 
        for design and art overall led me to enroll in CIS162: HTML and CSS! I'm looking forward to the projects in this class.

        One of my favorite websites is <a href="https://cerey.github.io/fighters-block/">Fighter's Block</a>, which is a simple writing app 
        that gamifies writing. You set your word count goal, which becomes the enemy's health, and your own fighter's health ticks 
        down while you're idle. I use it to get ideas in order and find it helps me avoid overthinking.
